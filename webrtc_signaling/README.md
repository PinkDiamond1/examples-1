Centrifugo as signaling server for WebRTC.

This chat application uses WebRTC to create a peer-to-peer, server-less connection
between you and the recipient of your chat messages. This chat uses
<a href="https://github.com/centrifugal/centrifugo">Centrifugo</a> as signaling server
and <a href="https://github.com/muaz-khan/WebRTC-Experiment/tree/master/DataChannel">DataChannel</a>
javascript library for peer-to-peer communication. This demo inspired by
<a href="https://pusher.com/tutorials/webrtc_chat">WebRTC demo</a> of <a href="https://pusher.com">Pusher.com</a> real-time API service.

First run Centrifugo with config like this:

```javascript
{
  "token_hmac_secret_key": "secret",
  "publish": true,
  "client_insecure": true
}
```

So javascript client could publish into channels directly and we don't need to
pass connection parameters from application backend. Note that as usually in demos
we use insecure options to simplify learning curve. In production you should
follow Centrifugo best practices.

Start Centrifugo with config above:

```
./centrifugo --config=config.json
```

Now start serving this chat application running from inside this folder:

```
python3 -m http.server 3000
```

Then go to http://localhost:3000/ and follow instructions.
